Gaurav Dhungel grew up in Kathmandu — the capital of Nepal, with population density almost twice as high as NYC. His father instilled in him the importance of education from his early childhood, while his mother inspired him to be self-sufficient. After graduating valedictorian of his high school, Gaurav left the concrete jungle in pursuit of an Associate degree in Forestry in Hetauda – a “city” almost 50 miles south of Kathmandu. The 2-year academic journey – which he originally thought of as a city escape, furthered his interest in forestry and natural resources, and he ended up earning an undergraduate degree in Forestry.

His knack for running away from his hometown only got bigger and better when he hopped on the plane for the first time and moved halfway around the world to pursue an MS in Forestry and Natural Resource Science at the University of Kentucky. There, he developed a plethora of soft and hard skills, including his love for Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data and his digital research interest in oaks. Gaurav continued his academic pursuit by enrolling in a doctoral program at North Carolina State University, where he majored in Forestry and Environmental Resources with a minor in Economics. Although his research in hardwood economics was a bit of a unicorn in the pine country, he found his niche – thanks to several collaborative opportunities through the Southern Forest Resource Assessment Consortium (SOFAC) and the US Forest Service-Southern Research Station.

After his 9 to 5, Gaurav likes to hit the gym, read the NYT, and listen to Apple podcasts. On weekends, he enjoys biking, thrifting, and grocery shopping. Gaurav describes himself as a work-from-home forester recently trained to think like an economist – or an oakonomist (a moniker, he takes great pride in coining).
